  "contents": "<p>As Software Engineers, we spend a big part of our time writing code. But there's something equally important that often gets overlooked, <strong>how we commit our changes</strong>.</p><p>A good commit is not just about saving code. It's about communicating intent. It tells a story, what changed, why it changed, and where. Over time, your commit history becomes a living document of your project's evolution.</p><p>Unfortunately, many developers either commit <em>too much at once</em> or <em>too little too often</em>, which makes that history hard to follow. Let's look deeper into why meaningful commits matter, and how we can do them better.</p><hr><h2>The Problem: One Big Commit vs. Too Many Micro-Commits</h2><p>Imagine you are working on a new feature, say, <strong>\"User Profile Update.\"</strong></p><p>To make this work, you need to:</p><ul><li>Update the backend API to handle profile updates.</li><li>Modify the frontend to add a new \"Edit Profile\" form.</li><li>Adjust the validation logic for username and email.</li><li>Update the database migration script.</li></ul><p>Now, you have two extreme ways to commit this work:</p><p><strong>Option 1: One giant commit</strong></p><pre><code>Commit message: \"Added profile update feature\"</code></pre><p>This commit includes backend changes, frontend edits, validations, migrations, everything.</p><p>The problem?</p><ul><li>Hard to review.</li><li>Hard to understand which files belong to which part of the feature.</li><li>If something breaks later, it's tough to know where to start debugging.</li></ul><p><strong>Option 2: Too many micro-commits</strong></p><pre><code>Commit 1: \"Fixed typo in UserController\"\nCommit 2: \"Adjusted validation message\"\nCommit 3: \"Changed button color\"\nCommit 4: \"Refactored one line\"</code></pre><p>This also creates noise. Each commit is too small to tell a meaningful story.</p><hr><h2>The Middle Ground: Logical, Self-Contained Commits</h2><p>The best approach lies between those two extremes, <strong>commits that make logical sense</strong>.</p><p>Let's look at how I would handle the same \"User Profile Update\" feature:</p><ol><li><strong>Commit 1 – Backend changes:</strong><pre><code>Implemented API for updating user profile information</code></pre>This includes updates to the controller, service, and repository layers.</li><li><strong>Commit 2 – Frontend integration:</strong><pre><code>Added profile edit form and integrated with update API</code></pre>This covers React components, form validations, and API calls.</li><li><strong>Commit 3 – Database changes:</strong><pre><code>Added new column 'profile_picture' in users table</code></pre>This includes SQL migration scripts and related entity updates.</li><li><strong>Commit 4 – Minor fixes and cleanup:</strong><pre><code>Adjusted validation messages and fixed styling issues</code></pre></li></ol><p>Now, each commit has a purpose. Each one is <strong>small enough to review</strong> but <strong>complete enough to understand</strong>.</p><p>If someone in the future wants to see what was changed for the backend update, they can easily open that commit and get the full context without being lost in unrelated changes.</p><hr><h2>Why This Approach Helps</h2><ol><li><strong>Better Code Reviews:</strong><br>Reviewers can easily follow your logic and review one focused change at a time.</li><li><strong>Simpler Debugging:</strong><br>When a bug appears, you can look back through commits and pinpoint exactly where the issue was introduced.</li><li><strong>Clear Project History:</strong><br>Each commit tells a clear story, making your Git history meaningful and educational for new team members.</li><li><strong>Easier Rollbacks:</strong><br>If something goes wrong, you can revert a specific feature change instead of rolling back everything.</li></ol><hr><h2>Real-Life Example from My Experience</h2><p>In one of my projects, I had to add a new \"Email Notification\" feature. It required changes in several modules, event triggers, templates, scheduler, and user settings.</p><p>Instead of one large commit, I created commits like this:</p><ol><li><code>Added event trigger for email notifications</code></li><li><code>Created email template builder and placeholder support</code></li><li><code>Added scheduler for sending queued emails</code></li><li><code>Updated user settings for notification preferences</code></li></ol><p>A few weeks later, when another teammate had to modify the scheduler logic, they simply looked at the <strong>third commit</strong>. They immediately understood the related files, dependencies, and why certain decisions were made.</p><p>That's the power of meaningful commits.</p><hr><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>A clean commit history doesn't just make your repository look nice, it reflects how you think as a developer.<br>It shows that you value structure, clarity, and teamwork.</p><p>So next time you write code, don't just ask yourself <em>\"Does it work?\"</em>, also ask,<br><strong>\"Does my commit make sense?\"</strong></p><p>Because good commits are not just for Git, they're for people.</p>"
